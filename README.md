# Advanced Regression Assignment
- The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.
- The company wants to know â€”
-- Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
-- How well those variables describe the price of a house.

## General Information
- You are required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables. 
- This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables.
- They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. 
- Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- High values of +ve coeeficients suggest a high sale value, some of features are top 5:
-- GrLivArea, OverallQual, OverallCond, TotalBsmtSF, BsmtFinSF1
- High values of -ve coeeficients suggest a decrease in sale value, some of  features are top 5:
-- KitchenQual_TA, KitchenAbvGr, BsmtQual_TA, EnclosedPorch, MSSubClass
- Market value of the property is less than the Predicted Sale Price then time to buy.
